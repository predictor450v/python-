class Dog:  # We define a class called "Dog"

    def __init__(self, name, breed):  # The constructor (explained later)

# Now, let's create some Dog objects:
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")  # Creating an object called my_dog
another_dog = Dog("Lucy", "Labrador")     # Creating another object

# We can access their attributes:
print(my_dog.name)       # Output: Buddy
print(another_dog.breed)  # Output: Labrador

# And make them perform actions:
my_dog.bark()            # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(Dog.species)       # Output: Canis familiaris
